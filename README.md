# Odin Recipes

This is my first project from [The Odin Project's Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/).  
It is a simple HTML project where Iâ€™ll build a basic recipe website using only HTML.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Basic Git and GitHub workflow (clone, commit, push)
- Setting up a project directory
- Writing semantic HTML
- Creating and linking multiple HTML files
